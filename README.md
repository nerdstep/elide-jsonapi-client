> An opinionated [{json:api}](http://jsonapi.org) client for [Elide](http://elide.io) based APIs

There are already a number of client libraries for working with JSON API, however this library is specifically designed for interacting with Elide based APIs, which has a few of it's own unique characteristics.

## Features

- Built with Typescript!
- Built on top of [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) as a peer dependency
- JSON API response normalization
  - Flatter structure
  - Merges included relationship data
- Serializes normalized resources back to a JSON API structure
  - Dates are converted to Unix epoch time for Elide
  - Protected fields can be omitted from being sent to the API
- Supports [JSON Patch Extension] for bulk writes and complex mutations(https://github.com/json-api/json-api/blob/9c7a03dbc37f80f6ca81b16d444c960e96dd7a57/extensions/jsonpatch/index.md)
- Parameter serialization
  - Fields, filter, include, sort
  - [Pagination](http://elide.io/pages/guide/10-jsonapi.html#pagination): `size` & `number` OR `offset` & `limit`
